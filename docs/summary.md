The codebase implements a document storage service with an API for creating, retrieving, and updating documents and their associated versions. Documents are stored with metadata including subject ID, subject type, category, year, country code, and owner. Each document can have multiple versions, each with a file, file name, uploaded by, version timestamp, and reason. The API allows for retrieving a list of documents based on various filters, retrieving metadata and links to files for a specific document, creating new documents with versions, and updating document metadata. The service also includes a Kafka producer for publishing document events to a Kafka topic.
