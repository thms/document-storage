The codebase implements a document storage service with an API for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting documents. Documents are associated with subjects and versions, and each version contains a file. The API allows for uploading new versions of existing documents and retrieving the content of a specific version. The service also includes a Kafka producer that publishes document events to a Kafka topic, enabling real-time updates and notifications. The codebase utilizes Paperclip for file storage and AvroTurf for message serialization.
